I am a tenure track Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Enginnering Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT - STADIUS division) at KU Leuven. My research is in the area of embedded system design, with focus on healthcare applications. My topics of interest include hardware/software co-design, embedded security and edge computing architectures.

In 2014, I obtained a joint PhD degree from KU Leuven (Belgium) and Radboud University Nijmegen (the Netherlands), with a doctoral thesis entitled "[Implementation Aspects of Security and Privacy in Embedded Design](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/269694){:target="_blank"}". Before that, I graduated as Telecommunications Engineer at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC).

In 2012 I was a graduate technical intern at the Intel's Security Center of Excellence (SeCoE) in Hillsboro, Oregon (United States). Between 2014 and 2019 I was postdoctoral researcher in the COSIC research group at KU Leuven. Between September 2017 and May 2018 I was research visitor in the Low Power Design, Test, Verification, and Fault Tolerance (QinE) group at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC).

I am teaching the courses "[Digital Design Concepts](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/T2VDO2E.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp1214464){:target="_blank"}" and "[Complex Digital Design](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/2023/syllabi/e/T3WDO2E.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp11929872){:target="_blank"}" at the *Bachelor of Engineering Technology*, and the course "[R&D Experience - Embedded Systems](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/T47UXWE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp2142096){:target="_blank"}" at the *Master of Electronics and ICT Engineering Technology*.
